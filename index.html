      <h2 clas="h2">Self Assessment</h2>
      <p>Finishing my class work through the SNHU computer science program, as well as working on this eportfolio, has given me a great opportunity to demonstrate my strengths, 
        prepare for future opportunities in the computer science field, and define my professional values. All of this has helped me understand how to create efficient software as well as how to 
        communicate my work to both non-technical and technical audiences. Here I have assembled what I feel is my best work into one place where I can showcase my wide range of skills. </p>

      <p>Having worked on team projects through my time in this program has taught me how to effectively collaborate in a shared codebase. It has also taught me how to manage version control 
        with Git and how to resolve merging conflicts. I have learned the value of having clear communication when coordinating tasks, how to integrate features that were developed by my peers, 
        and how to give friendly, constructive code reviews.</p>

      <p>My course work and projects have given me practice in applying data structures as well as algorithms to help solve problems more efficiently. With the usage of hash tables, binary trees, 
        and lists I was able to store and retrieve data quickly. I have implemented searching and sorting algorithms for specific use cases as well. With my enhancements here, I have demonstrated my 
        skills with data structures and algorithms by updating the performance of my event tracker mobile app’s event display. I did this by refactoring it from a table layout into a RecyclerView structure 
        with a ViewHolder pattern.</p>

      <p>By breaking larger problems into more testable components, I have developed stronger software engineering practices. An example of this would be the use of patterns such as Model-View-Controller 
        (MVC) to separate any concerns. I have also utilized Agile principles to help iterate features more quickly. On the database side, I have created schemas, improved queries with the help of indexing, 
        and I have written parameterized SQL queries to help prevent any injection attacks. With my experience with databases such as SQLite, MongoDB, and MySQL, I have the flexibility to choose the appropriate
        tool based on the requirements of a given project.</p>

      <p>Even when I come across a project that does not have a direct security requirement, I always go into development with security on my mind. I always validate any user inputs, I avoid storing any sensitive 
        information in plain text, and I have used least privileged principals for permissions. As an example, in my work with mobile development, I have implemented a runtime permission request for sensitive actions. 
        This is used when sending SMS messages. Having runtime permission requests makes sure the app is only accessing what is needed when it is needed.</p>

      <p>The artifacts I have provided in my eportfolio showcase the integration of my skills across several domains. Even though each enhancement has a focus on a specific area, areas like algorithmic efficiency, database functionality, 
        and UI refactoring, they work together to show a complete software development process. My collection that I have given here shows my abilities to design, implement, test, and improve software solutions. Having the combination
        of security awareness, great communication skills, and technical depth puts me in a position to help contribute in a fast paced, collaborative development environment.</p>
