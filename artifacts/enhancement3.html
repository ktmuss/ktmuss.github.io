      <h2 class="h2">Narrative</h2>
      <p>The artifact that I have chosen is from my CS-360 class. The project form that class is an Event Tracker Android App. 
        I built it by using Java for the logic and XML for the Android interface. My app gives users the ability to create, view, 
        and delete events. The data is stored in a local SQLite database. My enhanced version I have submitted features a search field 
        that will filter events by date. It uses SQL queries and updates the list dynamically through a RecyclerView</p>

      <p>I included this artifact because it demonstrates integration of database management, real time data filtering in an Android environment, 
        and user interface development. I chose to enhance this project because it will show that I am able to combine back end logic with front end 
        usability in a scalable way and that’s practical for real world mobile apps. My enhancement was inserting a search method for users to look up events 
        by their date. This shows that I have skills in writing SQL queries, binding data to a modern UI component, and manipulating cursors. </p>

      <p>I did meet some course outcomes. The outcomes I met were outcomes 3 (employ algorithms and data structures to solve computing problems) and 4 (demonstrate 
        software development skills using multiple programming languages, tools, and paradigms). My coverage plan still remains unchanged and, I believe, was met with this 
        latest enhancement.</p>

      <p>Going through the process of enhancing the artifact has taught me a lot. It taught me how to better manage the flow data between database and user interface. I have 
        gained more knowledge of cursor parsing, logic filtering, and managing UI lifecycle components such as the RecyclerView and their adapters. A challenge I had faced was maintaining 
        responsiveness and UI clarity when displaying filtered results. This needed a better understanding of how adapters can update views as well as how to avoid leaks in memory while handling cursors.</p>
